first repository examples 

**Branches:**
  Github creates one branch once a repository is created. This branch method helps user doing experiments on their projects and not affecting the main project, unless they commit the experimental change.
  When a sub-branch is created, it is a copy of the main branch with the new edit. Things to note, when the main branch changes with its sub-branch, you can pull in those updates!
